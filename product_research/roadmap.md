# Roadmap

This describes our plans...

- Setup a roadmap for at least the duration of this course. You may go longer to indicate long term goals. The roadmap can include as much detail as you want with the following conditions:
    - Must include your immediate next steps
    - Must include plans to perform user research
    - Must include low-fidelity plans for a launch date
    - You fill in the gaps. Be careful not to go too detailed as we have limited knowledge still.

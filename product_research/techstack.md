## Application Layer
We intend to use React to implement our user interface over other libraries because it is versatile and it also offers fast performance as it uses a virtual DOM (document object model). We decided on Node.js for the environment because it is efficient and distinctly scalable. 

## Services & Network
We chose PostgreSQL over other databases such as mySQL or MongoDB because PostgreSQL offers validity checks for data and it is highly efficient in managing requests. We plan on using Ethereum as our platform because our application can be built on it seamlessly and it uses smart contracts, and we intend to use Solidity because it is high level and many popular blockchains use it including Ethereum. 

## Infrastructure Layer
In terms of cloud storage, we intend to use Amazon S3 because members of our team have used it in past internships and AWS offers services specifically for Blockchain. AWS also offers integrated tools for data analysis, Elastic Beanstalk for web deployment and CloudWatch for DevOps so that we can monitor our resources. However, we may pivot away from Amazon S3 since at this stage in our start-up we want to use an affordable cloud storage option such as Backblaze B2, Storj, or Wasabi, depending on our needs. Storj also offers decentralized cloud storage, however we do not know if decentralized storage is something we need or if it may conflict or further complicate our project.

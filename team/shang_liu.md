## About

My name is Shang. I am a senior student at the University of Toronto, major in Computer Science.  Last summer, I interned at Facebook as Network Engineer Intern, worked on Device Config Validation and Provisioning tools. I have also interned at Tencent as a software developer, focusing on the backend development of Tencent Video Application where I have implemented features that are accessible to over 100 million premium users on our app. I have also worked on internal tools such as created a reporting tool to track the development team's progress, this tool is used widely by the whole Engineering depart of Tencent Video now. For my PEY, I was working at PointClickCare as a software engineer intern. Mainly responsible for the backend development of an internal test reporting tool that is used by over 30 scrum teams in the company. My internships are mainly about backend development, which is also what I am passionate about.

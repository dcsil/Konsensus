# Team Principles

## Communication
- Team members will mainly communicate using a private slack channel: konsensus.
- The channel will be used to schedule meetings, delegate assignment tasks and maintain progress of all members. 
- On specific issues and questions, the relevant members should be tagged in the initial message and follow up responses should be kept within the same thread.
- General questions can be directed to the group at large.  
- Thumbs up/down and other friendly reactions are encouraged to acknowledge important questions and answers.
- Members are expected to check the group at least once a day (Monday-Friday) - members unable to do so are expected to notify the team in advance.
- **Emergencies**: In an emergency, all members have each other's contact information. These mediums of communication are to only be used in rare cases. 

The main aim of these expectations is to foster a productive, inclusive and respectful environment where every member can leverage their strengths and grow. 

We’re not just a group, we’re a team. Combining our efforts and supporting each other is how we succeed. 

## Meetings
- We will hold regular (at least weekly) meetings for our team members. Currently, we plan on holding these meetings at 9PM EST on Wednesdays. We have also allocated 1PM EST on Saturdays for an additional midweek sync/work session. 
- Members are responsible for attending the team meetings. 
However, if they are unable to make a meeting, they must let other attendees know as soon as possible. In this event, they must make a plan to compensate for their absence. This could mean delivering an update asynchronously through Slack and catching up on what was discussed in the meeting to understand their new tasks.

## Work
- While tasks will be delegated to individuals, we are all there to support each other on course related work - submissions reflect our work as a group.  
- Any course related work will be delegated based on an individual’s experience and preference. Assigned work will be detailed on Github Issues. 
- In emergencies or if any assigned work proves to be more challenging, member(s) responsible for that task are expected to notify the team as soon as possible.
- Members are expected to complete assigned tasks within a reasonable time frame in order to allow other members to review, discuss, and amend before implementation. Pull requests on Github will be used to coordinate this.
  
## Other Issues
- While we cannot predict what issues may arise, members are encouraged to communicate any issues or problems they are facing in and out of the course. The team will collaboratively come up with a plan to overcome future roadblocks.
